Are you always waiting at your villagers until they finally restock? Do you want to see the schedule the villagers follow? Then VillagerTimetable is the mod for you!

VillagerTimetable adds the ability to visualize the work schedules of your villagers. You can see exactly when they start to work, or go to sleep. The mod also adds an optional HUD overlay to see the current work cycle.

By default the Timetable screen is bound to the "V" key.

ModMenu is supported for changing settings.
