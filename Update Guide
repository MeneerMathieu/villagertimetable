How to update the project to the next Minecraft version.


1. Update Gradle. You can't continue without updating Gradle. If you continue without updating Gradle, it will not update later.

    ./gradlew wrapper --gradle-version latest --distribution-type bin

2. Update gradle.properties with info from https://fabricmc.net/develop and https://linkie.shedaniel.dev/
3. Reload Gradle (This might take a while)
4. If code changes are needed, make them.
5. Build the project and upload to Modrinth.
6. Done :D
